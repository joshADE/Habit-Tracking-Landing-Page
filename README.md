# Habit-Tracking-Landing-Page
A landing page for a fictional app that tracks habits.

## Background
I was tasked with creating a solution for a challenge for a job. I decided on making an app called Habitly, which is an app that tracks health related habits. 
I created some mock ups in Figma of the app [here](https://www.figma.com/file/eArohFYDhr41had8MVshJu/Habitly-Mockup), but I never had time in challenge to actually get to develop the app.
I decided that it would be cool to create a landing page for the app to showcase my development skills.
